# qzr-sheet

Bible Quiz scoresheet app. Tauri 2 + Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript.

## Commands

```sh
pnpm dev          # Vite dev server (web only)
pnpm tauri dev    # Tauri native window (hot-reload)
pnpm test:unit    # Vitest unit tests
pnpm type-check   # vue-tsc
pnpm format       # Prettier (no semi, single quotes, 100 col)
```

## Project Structure

## Key Conventions

* Scoring functions are **pure** — `cells[teamIdx][quizzerIdx][colIdx]` in, result out. No Vue.
* Column keys: `"1"`–`"15"`, `"16"`/`"16A"`/`"16B"` through `"20B"`, `"21"`+ for overtime.
* Tests live in `__tests__/` subdirectories next to the code they test.
* Slight preference for writing tests before features.
* Redundant comments are not helpful. Prefer to make the code readable and maintainable instead of
  just adding comments. Only add comments to explain "why" if not immediately obvious, or to explain
  complex logic.
* Commits should be atomic and self-contained, with conventional commit messages. Use branches for
  larger features or refactors.

## Gotchas

* `createQuizStore()` is a factory — no singleton. Call it fresh per test.
* `buildColumns(n)` takes an overtime round count; `n=0` means no OT columns at all.
* `isErrorPoints` is true for Q17–20 and all OT columns — **not** Q16.
* Foul deduction does not stack: 3rd-team-foul + foul-out on the same foul = only −10.
* Drag reorder uses pointer events only (no HTML5 drag API — crashes on Linux/X11).

## Reference Docs

When working on scoring logic, rules, or architecture, read the relevant file first:

* `ROADMAP.md` — feature breakdown and implementation plan
* `docs/scoring-rules-explained.md` — cell types, point values,
  toss-up/bonus/A-B/foul/overtime/placement
* `docs/rules.md` -- full rules from official pdf
* `docs/architecture.md` — data flow, layer responsibilities, key design decisions
